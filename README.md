Go is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.</br>
Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.</br>
The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.</br>
How do we run GO projects in CMD :</br>
- **go build** : Compiles a bunch of go source code files
- **go run** : Compiles and executes one or two files
- **go fmt** : Formats all the code in each file in the current directory
- **go install** : Compiles and "installs" a package. 
- **go get** : Downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
- **go test** : Runs any tests associated with the current project
